	<div class="body-text">Originally from Taiwan, I grew up in Singapore and Shanghai before moving to Tucson, Arizona for college. I am a global citizen at heart and am always happy to make friends and collaborate with people from all over the world, and from all walks of life. Outside of optics, I am a passionate musician and enjoy playing chamber music. During my time at the Fred Fox School of Music, I played in both the Arizona Symphony and the UA Philharmonic. I am also passionate about mentoring the next generation of creatives through volunteering with organizations like Girls Who Code. My time in Arizona has been marked by many great mentors, and it gives me great satisfaction to be able to give back to this community.</div>
