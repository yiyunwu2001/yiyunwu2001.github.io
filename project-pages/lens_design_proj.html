I have experience starting from a first-order design as well as optimizing from a starting point in both Zemax and Code V. As a part of a summer internship with ASML in Wilton, CT, I gained experience putting together optical systems using commerically-available lenses as a part of a testbed modification plan. I also have experience making lens drawings and documentation in order to solicit a quote from lensmakers.</div>

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:

group to correct for spherical aberration and coma. The second lens group has almost no
power, so I optimized it for field correction, correcting for field curvature, astigmatism, and
distortion. I used model glasses during optimization, and then used a glass map to find suitable
glasses once I was close to a solution.</span>
